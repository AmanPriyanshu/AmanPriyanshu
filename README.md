### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Who am i?
----
My name is Aman Priyanshu, I am a machine learning and deep learning enthusiast with a taste for cybersecurity and quantum computing. I really really enjoy working on Open Source Projects and would love to contribute to the community as a whole.

I am currently studying in Manipal Institute of Technology for Undergrad in Information Technology. (Batch of 2019-2023)
I am part of the Cryptonite Team, which is the CyberSecurity Team of my Insititute.

#### Interests:
----
* I enjoy working on ML and DL projects
* Reinforcement Learning is something I want to pursue in detail, however, lack much experience on it
* Pure Mathemetics
* Quantum Computing
* Cryptography

#### Favourite Repositories:
----
* [Discussing Learning](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Discussing_Learning)

Here I talk about my takes on a lot of ML and DL algorithms. And hope to include a lot of paper implementations in the future. Check out some of the projects I have up there. Topics include, Active Learning, Bayesian Optimizations, Statistical Learning, etc.

* [Quantum Computing Basics](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Quantum-Computing-Intro)

I have written out a lot of basics I learnt over my process of learning QC. However, there is a lot more to add. In the meantime, take a look at some [Implementations of it in Qiskit](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Understanding-Quantum-With-Qiskit).

* [Py-SOS](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/py-stochastic-outlier-selection)

My implementation Stochastic Outlier Selection. You can download it and directly implement it for different datasets. It is One Class Classification Algorithm.

* [PDF-Classifier](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/pdf_classifier)

A deployable projects to help classify similar PDFs into different folders. It uses Unsupervised Learning - K-Means and uses TF-IDF vectorization.
